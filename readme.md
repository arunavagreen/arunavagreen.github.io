---Design Documentation---

1) Demonstrate your understanding of your site's audience:

My personal site's design is influenced by my audience: technology professionals, employers, possible non-technical employers. They appreciate a flat design, a responsive deisgn that works on all sizes of screens, and being time-poor, a fast snapshot of personal profile through a single-page design before they can go to the links to Github, Twitter, and Linkedin profiles provided in the website. That is why my personal site is responsive, flat-minimalist with only colors provided by images and not buttons and text, and single-page.

My audience would also be receptive to a display of personality and individualism. The text in my resume, links to my Twitter profile and Linkedin profile and my images and the overall style of the site provide ample expression of my personality.  

2) Demonstrate the design decisions made:

Conforming to my overarching design philosophy:
Flat design
Minimalist
Single-page fast-loading
Responsive
Containing personal pictures and photos and links to Github, Twitter, Linkedin profiles
I have customised the site to use my personal photos, details, and resume


3) Demonstrate that you considered usability heuristics:

a) Visibility of system status

The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time. : The site will be updated and users informed of the changes. 

b) Match between system and the real world

The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. : the site uses plain English terms and is simple to navigate being single-page. 

c) User control and freedom

Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo. : will be considered when the site is made database-driven. As of now it is single-page and simple to use with no scope for errors. 

d) Consistency and standards

Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions. : considered and adhered to. 

e) Error prevention

Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. : will be considered when the site is made database-driven. As of now it is single-page and simple to use with no scope for errors. 

f) Recognition rather than recall

Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. : as of now not an issue.

g) Flexibility and efficiency of use

Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. :  : the site uses plain English terms and is simple to navigate being single-page and also responsive. 

h) Aesthetic and minimalist design

Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. :the site uses plain English terms and is simple to navigate being single-page and also responsive and flat. 

i) Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors

Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. :will be considered when the site is made database-driven. As of now it is single-page and simple to use with no scope for errors. 

j) Help and documentation

Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. : will be considered when the site is made database-driven. As of now it is single-page and simple to use with no scope for errors.
